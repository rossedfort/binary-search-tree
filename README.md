README - Binary Search Tree

In this project I am creating a binary search tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), and giving it the functionality to insert and delete nodes, find nodes based on content, find the depth of a particular node, find the minimum and maximum nodes, and sort the contents of the nodes into an array.

As a bonus, I am giving it the functionality to find the maximum height of the tree, and return the number of leaves in the tree.

README - Binary Search Tree

In this project I am creating a binary search tree(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), and giving it the functionality to insert and delete nodes, find nodes based on content, find the minimum and maximum nodes, and sort the contents of the nodes into an array.

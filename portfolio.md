      ###Your Mission

      "This module, I set out to get better every day through consistent practice.
      I wanted my projects to reflect on my effort. I also wanted to attend a Meetup
      or other activity outside of Turing."

      (multiple expectations weren't implemented properly
        App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
        the `count` function emptied the list.
        Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs
        Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of encapsulation
        Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it excellent)

      (* Functional Expectations: 1
       * Test-Driven Development: 2
       * Encapsulation: 1
       * Ruby & Style: 2

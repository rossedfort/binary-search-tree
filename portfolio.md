      (multiple expectations weren't implemented properly
        App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
        the `count` function emptied the list.
        Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs
        Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of encapsulation
        Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it excellent)
